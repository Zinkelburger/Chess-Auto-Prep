# Chess Auto Prep

"Mom can I buy aimchess"
"We have aimchess at home"

Goals:
- Blunder review
- Opening repertoire builder, find holes/mistakes in your existing repertoire
- Create targeted preparation for opponents. Using their games, lichess database, stockfish, and maia

Just a tool for myself to help make master.
