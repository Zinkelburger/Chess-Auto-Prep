- Shows Mate in 1's, in the tactics trainer. Presumably because the "position to next position" eval measurement is broken for them, look into that, last move of a game SF evaluation
- Sometimes there could be a tactic position where there are many alternative solutions (e.g. if the user made a horrible blunder in an equal position, almost any move is good to maintain the balance of the original position). Not sure how to solve this one, or if its even that important. But worth noting.
