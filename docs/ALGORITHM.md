# Expectimax Pipeline & Algorithm Reference

## Overview

Chess Auto-Prep builds repertoire trees using a BFS-based expectimax algorithm that combines engine evaluation, human move prediction (Maia), and database statistics to produce practical repertoire recommendations.

This document describes the **Flutter/Dart** generation pipeline in `lib/`. The native C `tree_builder` CLI (including `--resume`, `cli_args` persistence, db-explorer PGN ingest, and default thread count) is documented in [`tree_builder/ALGORITHM.md`](../tree_builder/ALGORITHM.md) and summarized under **External & non-Flutter components** in [`COMPONENT_MAP.md`](COMPONENT_MAP.md).

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Candidate Generation

For each position in the BFS frontier:

**Our moves (configurable source):**
- **Maia (default):** Top-N moves ranked by Maia's predicted human probability. Ships with Flutter, no engine needed. Configured via `EngineSettings.candidateSourceOur`.
- **Stockfish:** MultiPV top-N moves by engine evaluation. Configured via `EngineSettings.stockfishTopN`.

**Opponent moves (configurable source):**
- **Maia (default):** Moves weighted by Maia predicted probability. Configured via `EngineSettings.candidateSourceOpp`.
- **Stockfish:** MultiPV opponent responses.
- **Lichess DB:** Opponent moves weighted by actual game frequency when DB data is available.

### 2. Evaluation Resolution (Eval Chain)

Evaluations are resolved through a multi-source chain, stopping at the first hit:

1. **Session cache** — in-memory hash of previously evaluated positions
2. **Local eval DB** (ChessDB direct file) — pre-downloaded centipawn evaluations
3. **Stockfish** — local engine evaluation at configured depth

Depth is configurable via `TreeBuildConfig.evalDepth` (default 14).

### 3. BFS Tree Build

```
start_fen
  └── our_move_1 (Maia top candidate)
  │     └── opp_response_1 (by DB frequency)
  │     └── opp_response_2
  └── our_move_2
        └── ...
```

**Pruning rules:**
- `minProbability` (default 0.02): branches with cumulative probability below this threshold are not explored
- `maxEvalLossCp` (default 80): our moves losing more than 80cp vs best are pruned
- `maxPly`: configurable tree depth (plies from root)
- `maxNodes`: hard cap on total tree nodes

### 4. Ease Calculation

**`myEase` (our moves, 0.0–1.0):**
How natural our chosen move is for a human to find. Computed from Maia's predicted probability for the move:
- If Maia says we'd play this move 80% of the time → myEase ≈ 0.80
- Only reasonable move (>200cp gap to 2nd best) → myEase = 1.0
- Engine-best but Maia-unlikely (<15%) → clamped to 0.5 max

**`ease` (opponent positions, 0.0–1.0):**
How easy it is for the opponent to find a good move at this position. Lower ease = opponent struggles more = better for us.

**`positionQuality` (unified, 0.0–1.0):**
- Our nodes: `positionQuality = myEase` (best repertoire child)
- Opponent nodes: `positionQuality = 1 - ease`

### 5. Expectimax Calculation

Minimax with probabilistic opponent moves:

```
V(our_node) = max over our children of V(child)
V(opp_node) = Σ P(child) × V(child)  for all opponent children
V(leaf)     = winProbability(evalCp)
```

`P(child)` is the Maia/DB frequency of the opponent's move. The result `V` is displayed as "% win" (practical win rate given human opponents).

### 5b. CPL Value Propagation (Trappy Mode)

When `SelectionMode.trappy` is selected, a parallel propagation computes `cplValue` — the total expected centipawn loss by the opponent downstream from each node:

```
cplV(leaf)     = 0
cplV(opp_node) = localCpl + Σ P(child) × cplV(child)
cplV(our_node) = max over eval-guarded children of cplV(child)
```

Where `localCpl` is the probability-weighted centipawn loss at a single opponent node (how much the opponent loses on average relative to their best move). The `cplValue` accumulates this across the whole subtree.

**Trappy selection** picks our moves to maximize `cplValue` instead of expectimax `V`. Build tolerances are automatically widened (matching the C `--traps` preset: `maxEvalLossCp` ≥ 100, `minEvalCp` relaxed to -100/-300 for White/Black) so the tree explores speculative territory where traps are more likely.

### 6. Line Quality (Playability)

**Geometric mean** of `positionQuality` across ALL nodes in a line (both sides):

```
lineQuality = exp(mean(log(clamp(q, 0.01, 1.0))))
```

Where `q` = `positionQuality` at each node. This correctly penalizes:
- Lines where our moves are hard to find (low myEase)
- Lines where opponent moves are easy to find (high ease → low 1-ease)

**Hard moves (bottleneck):** The position with the minimum `positionQuality` in a line, excluding the root position (not a move) and the first ply where it is our turn (opening choice). Surfaced with a warning when quality < 0.3. When the bottleneck falls on an opponent-move position, the label reads "easy for opponent" instead of "hard move."

### 7. Trap Detection

A position is a "trap" when:
- It's the opponent's turn
- A popular opponent move (high DB frequency or Maia probability) is significantly worse than the best move
- `trapScore = popularMoveProb × evalDiff / 1000`

After identifying a trap, the extractor also records the **refutation move** — our best reply after the opponent plays the popular blunder (repertoire move preferred, otherwise highest-eval child).

Traps are indexed by `TrapIndexService` for O(1) lookup by FEN and per-line queries.

### 8. Coverage Suggestion

`CoverageSuggestionService` identifies gaps in repertoire coverage:
1. Collect gaps: unaccounted opponent moves + too-shallow leaves
2. Resolve: walk tree to find continuations
3. Score: weighted combination of coverage impact, eval, ease, trap potential
4. Select: greedy set-cover to reach target coverage %

### 9. Coherence Analysis

`CoherenceService` uses FP-Growth to find frequent move patterns across repertoire lines, identifying structural consistency. Lines sharing common strategic motifs cluster together; outliers may need review.
